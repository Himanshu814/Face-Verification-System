Face Verification System

## Overview

The Face Verification System is an advanced application designed to facilitate secure and efficient identity verification using facial recognition technology. This system is tailored for applications such as secure voting processes, access control, and identity management. Built with Python, it leverages OpenCV, Tkinter, and MySQL to provide a robust and interactive user experience.

## Features
### 1. Face Recognition and Verification:

- Identify and verify users based on their facial features.
- Display verification results in real-time.

### 2. Voter Management:

- Add, update, and delete voter details.
- Manage voter-specific attributes, including images and personal details.

### 3. Dataset Training:

- Train the system with labeled datasets using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm.
- Generate and save training models for future use.
### 4. Real-Time Interaction:

- Capture live data using webcams for image acquisition and verification.
- Real-time validation with high accuracy thresholds.

### 5. Data Export/Import:

- Export verified data to CSV.
- Import existing voter details from CSV.
